# üí° World Texturing with Semantic Segmentation
This project makes use of Lightship ARDK's Semantic Segmentation to segment the world into different labels for example <b>skies</b> are labelled as <b>sky</b> or <b>trees</b> as <b>foliage</b>

With these segmented labels we can easily put textures on top of environments which can produce phenomenal Augmented Reality Experiences thus effecting the look of the actual world, sounds amazing right!

So, here goes a demo showcasing the replacement of the sky with an image by using ARDK's Semantic Segmentation
